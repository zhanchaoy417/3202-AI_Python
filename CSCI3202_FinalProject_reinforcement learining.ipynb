    "This is your final programming project for CSCI 3202. It is due on Canvas by **11:59 PM on Saturday April 30**.  Your solutions to theoretical questions should be done in Markdown/LateX directly below the associated question. Your solutions to computational questions should include any relevant Python code, as well as results and any written commentary.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have two options for completing your final project for this course. The first option is presented in this notebook and involves implementing a reinforcement learning algorithm and producing a five-minute video that explains your process of solving this problem. The second option is to design your own project that includes the algorithms we've discussed since the midterm - Bayes Nets, Hidden Markov Models, Markov Decision Processes, or Reinforcement Learning - or an algorithm related to one of these that we haven't discussed in class. Your project also needs to include some kind of analysis of how it performed on a specific problem. If you're interested in the design your own project option, you need to discuss your idea with one of the course instructors to get approval. If you do a project without getting approval, you will receive a 0 regardless of the quality of the project. You will also need to produce a short, five-minute video that explains your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The rules:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose EITHER the given problem to submit OR choose your own project topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. If you choose your own project topic, please adhere to the following guidelines:\n",
    "- The project needs to be approved by the course instructors.\n",
    "- The project needs to include one of the algorithms we've discussed since the midterm - Bayes Nets, HMMs, MDPs, or Reinforcement Learning - or an algorithm that we haven't discussed in class. \n",
    "- If you do your own project without prior approval, you will receive a 0 for this project.\n",
    "- Your project code, explanation, and results must all be contained in a Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. All work, code and analysis must be **your own**.\n",
    "4. You may use your course notes, posted lecture slides, textbook, in-class notebooks and homework solutions as resources.  You may also search online for answers to general knowledge questions, like the form of a probability distribution function, or how to perform a particular operation in Python. You may not use entire segments of code as solutions to any part of this project, e.g. if you find a Python implementation of policy iteration online, you can't use it.\n",
    "5. You may **not** post to message boards or other online resources asking for help.\n",
    "6. **You may not collaborate with classmates or anyone else.**\n",
    "7. This is meant to be like a coding portion of your final exam. So, we will be much less helpful than we typically am with homework. For example, we will not check answers, help debug your code, and so on.\n",
    "8. If you have a question, post it first as a **private** Piazza message. If we decide that it is appropriate for the entire class, then we will make it a public post (and anonymous).\n",
    "9. If something is left open-ended, it is probably because we intend for you to code it up however you want, and only care about the plots/analysis we see at the end. Feel free to ask clarifying questions though.\n",

    "Violation of these rules will result in an **F** and a trip to the Honor Code council.\n",

Each state is a 1 unit cube. So when $L=2$ (for example), there are cubes centered at each $x=0,1,2$, $y=0,1,2$ and so on, for a total state space size of $3^3 = 27$ states.\n",

    "1.Because at the beginning, our drone only cares about short-term benefits, it only wants to reach the terminal state, and doesn't care that it is -1/1, and in probability theory，most of the terminal state drone will take is -1, so drone will take many steps to reach -1, and the next time drone will take less steps to reach -1. And 0.5 is the difference in the number of steps spent. In this case, cumulative reward will not start from a number greater than 0 but start off around -0.5 (see first dot in the graph part d).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Because we want the drone to learn, a large learning rate makes it value long-term benefits, and the drone will target the terminal state of 1, so the value is positive. Due to the use of random start, drone may take a relatively small number of steps to reach 1 each time, plus there is a dicount factor each time, so 0.8 is the largest possible reward from random to landing. Limited by a fixed discount 0.999, a learning rate and the necessary number of steps to landing, discount  value makes continuous rewards less and less, so cannot get a reward much larger than 0.8 (see the last few dots of part d)."

    "First of all, the three rewards are different from the terminal and living reward of the previous rewards, so I increased the terminal value and decreased the landing value. $\\textbf{The first reward structure}$ is large default_reward, less dicount, same learning rate; $\\textbf{the second reward structure}$ is less default_reward, less dicount, same learning rate; $\\textbf{the third reward structure}$ is less default_reward, less dicount, less learning rate.\n",

    "I think that compared with the previous structure, the rewards of the new three structures will decrease. $\\textbf{My expectation}$ is that for Qlearning, among the three rewards, structure 1 $>$ structure 2 $>$ structure 3, and for policy iteration, the three reward structures are finally reach the landing state and the steps are the same. $\\textbf{The actual result}$ is as I expected. $\\textbf{The explanation}$ is that because drone pursues long-term interests, it pursues a state of +0.8, so under policy iteartion, the strategies of the three reward structures are the same, and these three utility decreases due to the decrease in landing interests. The difference between reward structures 1 and 2 is the default reward, because structure 1 has a larger value, so the cost of its steps is less, resulting in the average benefit of reward structure 1 $>$ structure 2; the difference between reward structures 2 and 3 is learning rate, because structure 2 has more A large learning rate, which tends to continuously learn to gain and update a larger utility, results in a reward structure 2 with an average benefit $>$ structure3."
